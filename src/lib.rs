#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! A crate providing lock-free data structures and a solution for the "ABA
//! problem" related to pointers.
//!
//! The incinerator is the API which tries to solve the "ABA problem" when
//! related to pointer dropping. With incinerator, every thread has a local
//! garbage list. Dropping a shared object consist of first removing the pointer
//! from the shared context, then adding the pointer to the garbage list.
//! A "pause counter" is checked. If the counter is zero, then the whole list
//! is deleted, otherwise, the list will only be deleted later.
//!
//! This counter is counting how many times the incinerator was asked to
//! "pause". A thread may pause the incinerator to load and use the shared
//! pointer, and this is why it is important to remove the pointer from the
//! shared context before deleting. Previous version of lockfree used a global
//! incinerator. Currently, a per-object incinerator is used.
//!
//! This crate is under development, and there are plans for some structures.
//! We have:
//! - `[x]` [Per-Object Thread-Local Storage](tls::ThreadLocal)
//! - `[x]` [Channels (SPSC, MPSC, SPMC, MPMC)](channel)
//! - `[x]` [Map](map::Map)
//! - `[x]` [Set](set::Set)
//! - `[x]` [Stack](stack::Stack)
//! - `[x]` [Queue](queue::Queue)
//! - `[ ]` [Deque](deque::Deque) (under construction)
//!
//! # Performance Guide
//! In order to achieve a better time performance with lockfree, it is
//! recommended to avoid global locking stuff like heap allocation.
